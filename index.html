                        to live in a community. You have already qualified, the rest of
                        your journey will be finding the right fit.

                        help. Welcome to our network.

                        and other forms that are easy to digitize. These are open source

                                    We are eight mostly queer mixed-gender folks from ages 25 to 33 
                                    living in a seven-room co-op in the Mission. 

                                    Our major values are cooperation and sharing, integrity and honesty, 
                                    growth and learning, and autonomy and playful agency. 
                                    As a group, we gather for house dinners twice a week, 
                                    with one being more optional than the other. 
                                    We also hold house meetings on Mondays every three weeks and 
                                    frequently hang out on weeknights and weekends (sometimes brunch!) 
                                    We also like connecting with the greater Bay Area co-op community 
                                    through dinners, parties, events, etc.

                                    goal is the creation, maintaining and diversifying the commons.

                                    Day to day our community runs as as a doocracy, with
                                    participatory decision making filling the gaps where doocracy
                                    falls down. We use collaborative funding to put our surplus
                                    towards projects we believe are important. Sometimes these are
                                    self serving (making an area of the house nice), sometimes these
                                    are community serving (subsidized housing, provision of child
                                    care for our events etc).

                                    Template House is an intentional community space in lower Haight.
                                    We inhabit a mixed use building, which is both a home and also a
                                    semi public community living room known as Revolution Sunday.
                                    We are 5 residents (so far) exploring co-creation, commoning,
                                    fluid use of space, and new ways of being in solidarity with one another.

                                    Template is home to our Second Life community - an autonomous,
                                    self-determined intentional community, built around transformation
                                    and empowerment, with and for the formerly incarcerated community,
                                    manifesting alternative justices approaches and values.

                                    In order to be inclusive to the needs and safety of our formerly
                                    incarcerated community, this space cannot have alcohol, weapons/anything
                                    that looks like a weapon or drugs/ controlled substances.
                                    Please never bring any of these things into the building.
                                </p>

                                    RGB is a community of 11 residents, mostly long-term, founded in January 2016. We
                                    believe life is better together. We believe in living by design, not by default. We
                                    believe the power of cities is in proximity, and the same can be true of our homes.
                                    We
                                    believe the people we surround ourselves with can make us a better, happier version
                                    of
                                    ourselves.

                                    We govern ourselves through a mix of doocracy, adhocracy, Slackocracy, and gentle
                                    loving
                                    nudges to take out the trash.

                                    At the core, we are life experimenters and social tinkerers. We want to see if
                                    there's a
                                    better way to live. RGB is our laboratory. The colors blend a different way
                                    everyday.

                                    projects. We host a number of events for the wider community,
                                    from life drawing, to monthly art shows and a weekly lecture
                                    series. Our newest addition to the community is a maker space.

                                    The residents are all very different, but we share a couple core values, including
                                    loving our Earth and the people that it is comprised of. Staying at Agape is likely
                                    very
                                    different than most living situations you've grown accustomed to and relies on the
                                    collective effort of everyone involved to keep our home running efficiently. Each of
                                    us
                                    have our own unique areas of responsibility that help sustain our community at large
                                    and
                                    we ask that anyone who stays with us contributes in a way that feels right to them.

                                    etc. We’ve liked hosting Hippie Happy Hours, Sad Parties, Yoga Nidra, Acro Yoga.

                                    We were founded in January 2016 by a group leaving their warehouse home - at which
                                    point
                                    this was, literally, the "new house." We’re either "intentionally unintentional" or
                                    "unintentionally intentional" depending on who you ask, and prefer organic over
                                    structured interaction. In any case, we’re all very close, supportive of each other,
                                    and
                                    love spending quality time together.

                                    like family to each other’s kids. We know that the whole can be more than the sum of
                                    its
                                    parts and we’re putting that into action.

                                    We're a group of late-20s to mid-30s adults who work in a range of professions, from
                                    data engineering to founders to design to doctors to social impact and public
                                    health.
                                    Our hobbies are even wider-ranging - we have jazz aficionados, survival enthusiasts,
                                    wrestling queens, bread bakers, runners, bikers, plant lovers, skilled cooks, beach
                                    volleyballers, roller skaters, and many more. From deep conversations to hanging out
                                    around the fire, we generally try to make space to connect and really get to know
                                    each
                                    other.

                                    McAllister House is a joyous cooperative community living in a 13-bedroom
                                    6.5-bathroom
                                    Victorian in the Alamo Square/NOPA neighborhood, San Francisco. We’re a diverse crew
                                    of
                                    thirteen ranging from early-20s to early-30s. We have a wide range of interests, but
                                    we’re fairly active/sporty and often bond by cooking/sharing meals with one another
                                    or
                                    working on projects to improve the house. We have a strong culture of hopping onto
                                    activities/events that housemates propose, be it water-coloring, rock-climbing,
                                    beach
                                    raves, or county fairs.

                                    Unlike some community houses, we do not have an explicit theme. Instead, we
                                    deliberately
                                    aim for a low key community with minimal hard rules. More info and pictures <a

                                    spacious
                                    than your typical SF group house. We’re looking for a few more humans to expand the

                                    true), and wrassle our golden retriever in the evenings. If (some of) this sounds

                                    We have a room availability in our very large and incredibly beautiful co-living space that's shared with six people and a pooch. The House is nestled among towering Eucalyptus trees in the Presidio of San Francisco and surrounded by three other co-living houses that, combined, create a community of over 25 people (more on the awesome community below). The House has tons of natural light and has views of the Bay. There's plenty of common space, including a cavernous sun room, a cozy mudroom, a grand foyer, a massive entertainment room, and an impeccably clean kitchen with brand-new appliances (literally new as in the past 2 months).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hands down we have one of the coolest communities in SF. Four large houses all next door to one another with 25 or so people in the community. It's really cool to see friend groups form across the homes and there are often community events and hangs. The neighborhood is filled with activities, like bonfires, community gardening, barbecues, moon walks, and more with neighbors, so you'll never be bored! Whatever you are into there are others to bond and hang with.

                                We’re a long-term coliving house near Dolores Park in San Francisco. We believe that a
                                community
                                that
                                cares for and empowers each other is key to a fulfilling and impactful life. We're just
                                a group
                                of
                                reasonable adults who believe life is happier and more interesting when you're
                                surrounded by
                                diverse
                                people who inspire you. We're introvert-friendly, have weekly group dinners, organize
                                occasional
                                retreats, and host friends and acquaintances for semi-regular potlucks.
